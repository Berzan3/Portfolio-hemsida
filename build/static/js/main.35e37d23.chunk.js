Inspired by games like Surgeon Simulator and the board game Operation. The game is intended for a broad target group as there is some blood in the game about 8 years and up. The game is that the player is a surgeon who must perform different transplants of different body parts. The level of difficulty in the game is stepped up in the form of the player having to replace more and more organs (maximum 3). When the player cuts off organs or limbs, the patient starts bleeding differently depending on which part of the body is lost, as you can see on a blood Monitor in the lower right corner of the screen and how much blood may be lost until the patient dies. The player uses the saw to cut off limbs, the chapel to cut loss organs and open up the torso and needle to sew everything back. When the player has cut loss the bad body part and replaced it with a healthy body part and then sewed everything together without the patient losing too much blood, the player has passed surgery and presenters then with a rating on its effort. If the player fails, he also gets a rating. The grading system goes from F to A and depends on how much blood the patient has lost and how correct the placement of the healthy body part is. In addition to teaching about the body's anatomy, we list a couple of fun facts about each of the body parts that you can read if you press \"Organ info\" up to the left and click or have clicked on a body part."),r.a.createElement("img",{src:"../img/Pixelsurgeon/pixelsurgeon-stats.png",alt:"pixelsurgeon-stats-img"}),r.a.createElement("body",null,r.a.createElement("h1",null,"My tasks"),"My role I worked on was mainly to create the controls for the game and handle input but I also made a script to handle when the patient should start or stop bleeding on those different blood positions on the body that chose the arms, legs and torso.

The actions the player can do in the game are then: pick up body parts / tools, rotate tools and sew / cut. The controls for performing these actions are based entirely on the mouse and include: left-click to click and hold objects, right-click to use the tool you are holding, and scroll wheel to rotate tools 90 degrees at a time. Picking up objects is then done with the help of a RaycastAll which its hit list sorts according to stock order and whether it is a tool or body part to decide what to pick up. It is necessary to remove bugs and annoying moments such as picking up something that is on the bottom even though it is slightly above that object. Using a tool is managed with the help of a switch kit which, depending on which tool was used, sends an event with the body part on which it was used. This is listened to by the Bodypart script, which decides whether the body part should be removed or inserted. Rotate is managed by first checking if you are holding something and if it is a tool.

Other things we changed about were the number of tools and whether the player could do brain transplants. We considered brain transplants to be too unrealistic as we still try to relate to some form of semi-realism in the game. The second was that we were content with only three tools because if we had added more, we think it would have been too cumbersome to keep track of.
