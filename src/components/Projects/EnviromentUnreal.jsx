                <p>The materials and textures were not made by me but imported from my university.
                When the buildng parts were done it was time to make the scene in Unreal engine.</p>

                    <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/scenbygge2.png")} alt="scenbygge2-PNG" />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                <p>I made two different vertex paint materials one for building walls and one for the house foundation.</p>

                <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/vertexpaint1.PNG")} alt="vertexpaint1-PNG" />
                    <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/MaterialEditorn_M_1.PNG")} alt="MaterialEditorn_M_1-PNG" />
                    <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/vertexpaint2.PNG")} alt="vertextpaint2-PNG" />
                    <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/MaterialEditorn_M_2.PNG")} alt="MaterialEditorn_M_2-PNG" />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                <p>I made five different particle effects: torchfire, bonfire, fireflies, chimneysmoke and candle-light.</p>
                <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles3.png")} alt="particles3-PNG" />
                    <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles1.PNG")} alt="particles1-PNG" />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                <p>The torchfire effect is very similar to bonfire, just slimmer, smaller and dimmer light.</p>
                <img src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles2.png")} alt="particles2-PNG" />


                    <img id="bigImage" src={require("../../img/EnviromentUnreal/moons.PNG")} alt="moons-PNG" />
                    <br />
                <p>The moons are two massive spheres with a transparent plane behind them that radiates a glow.
                They also have a script that makes them always face the player,
                so if the player moves far into a direction the moons still look realistic.</p>
                <br />
                    <br />

                <p>After i was pleased about how my scene looked with all the different post-process effects i recorded the video you can see at the top.
                The sounds are not made by me but imported.
                I had some trouble first with the grass flickering and not loading in properly when i filmed but that was fixed by giving
                the camera some starterframes to load in everything before starting to film.</p>

                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                <p>The biggest challenge for me during this project was modeling and uv-mapping.
                I had to simplify my design off the buildings because it would have taken too much time off the course to do the whole project.</p>

                <h1>Iteration</h1>
                <p>This was a fun project to do and I didnÂ´t stumble onto many problems during my work.
                I learned how to do basic modeling, uv-mapping and how to make a beautiful scene in Unreal engine.</p>
