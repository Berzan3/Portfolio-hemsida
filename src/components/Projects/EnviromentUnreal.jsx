                This is a 3D-environment i created in Unreal Engine at a 3D-rendering course at University.

                The materials and textures were not made by me but imported from my university.
                When the buildng parts were done it was time to make the scene in Unreal engine.

                <br />
                <br />
                i made two different vertex paint materials one for building walls and one for the house foundation.

                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/MaterialEditorn_M_1.png" alt="MaterialEditorn_M_1-png" />
                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/vertexpaint2.png" alt="vertextpaint2-png" />
                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/MaterialEditorn_M_2.png" alt="MaterialEditorn_M_2-png" />
                <br />
                <br />

                I made five different particle effects: torchfire, bonfire, fireflies, chimneysmoke and candle-light.
                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles3.png" alt="particles3-png" />
                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles1.png" alt="particles1-png" />
                <br />
                <br />
                The torchfire effect is very similar to bonfire, just slimmer, smaller and dimmer light.
                <img src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/particles2.png" alt="particles2-png" />


                <img id="bigImage" src="../img/EnviromentUnreal/moons.png" alt="moons-png" />
                <br />
                The moons are two massive spheres with a transparent plane behind them that radiates a glow.
                They also have a script that makes them always face the player,
                so if the player moves far into a direction the moons still look realistic.
                <br />
                <br />

                After i was pleased about how my scene looked with all the different post-process effects i recorded the video you can see at the top.
                The sounds are not made by me but imported.
                I had some trouble first with the grass flickering and not loading in properly when i filmed but that was fixed by giving
                the camera some starterframes to load in everything before starting to film.

                <h1>Challenges</h1>
                The biggest and only challenge for me during this project was modeling and uv-mapping.
                I had to simplify my design off the buildings because it would have taken too much time off the course to do the whole project.

                <h1>Iteration</h1>
                This was a fun project to do and I didnÂ´t stumble onto many problems during my work.
                I learned how to do basic modeling, uv-mapping and how to make a beautiful scene in Unreal engine.
